 * Merchants measured commodities by using weights and a two-pan balance.
 * This program writes a recursive function, that determines whether it is
 * possible to measure out the desired target amount with a given set of
 * weights
 * Ex: Given 1 and 3 ounce weight, we can measure objects with 1, 2, 3, 4
 * ounces
 *          objects                        \1/ \3/
